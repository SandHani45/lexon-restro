### Added
- **Self-serve live demo** - replaces the old flow of sending a stranger a video or booking a call: `/live-demo/` is a rate-limited magic link that logs a visitor straight in as a demo owner account, no signup, no waiting on us. Backed by an idempotent seed (`orders/scripts/demo_seed.py`, `reset_demo_tenant` management command) that gives every visitor the same clean slate - a tenant called "Demo Bistro," 8 tables, a 17-item menu across 5 categories, and 2 sample in-progress orders - with AI menu import and real payment gateways left off by default so nobody can accidentally rack up a real bill or burn real API quota poking around. 13 new tests, including one that proves a locked-out login form doesn't block the separate magic-link path.
- **"Try Live Demo" CTAs on the marketing page** - the demo above had no way for an actual visitor to find it; now it's the primary button in the nav bar, the hero section, and the final call-to-action, with the old WhatsApp contact option kept as a secondary path.
- **Demo trailer mode** - the live demo above launched with zero restrictions, letting a visitor rewrite the curated menu, manage staff, or flip on settings (vendor emails, payment gateway) that don't reset on the existing schedule and would have quietly stayed on for every visitor after. A session flag now blocks menu editing, staff management, and outlet/payment settings while leaving the actual day-to-day flow (orders, kitchen, billing, tables, dashboard) fully open, plus a small dismissible banner suggesting what to try. `/live-demo/?key=<DEMO_FOUNDER_KEY>` skips the restriction entirely for doing a live walkthrough yourself, since the shared demo account has no usable password to log in with normally. The reset that used to require running a command by hand now also runs automatically every 2 hours. 15 new tests, full suite 1354/1354 passing.

### Fixed
- **Split-bill QR accuracy** - the UPI "scan & pay" QR on the bill screen was drawn once at page load from the order's full remaining balance and never redrawn, so splitting a bill still asked the customer to pay everything, and the same stale QR printed onto the receipt. `renderUpiQR()` is now a real function, wired into both the payment-amount field and Split, so the QR always reflects the actual amount being collected.
- **Razorpay QR ignored splits entirely** - a second, worse version of the same problem: the Razorpay QR button never read the split amount at all and always requested the order's full balance from Razorpay, with no way to ask for less. It now accepts and validates a requested amount (bounded to the actual remaining balance) end to end - JS, view, and gateway call.
- **docker-compose.yml environment variable mismatch** - the `db` and `web` services read the database password from two different, cross-wired environment variable names, so a fresh container deploy would have connected with the wrong password. Both now read `DB_PASSWORD`, matching what the app itself expects everywhere else.
- **Blank gap at the top of the digital menu** - `fixStickyNav()` was copy-pasted from a different page with a `position:fixed` header. Here, both the header and category tabs are `position:sticky`, which already reserve their real height in the normal page flow, so the leftover code was adding that height again as margin, doubling it into a visible empty gap. Removed the redundant push; kept the parts still needed (positioning the category tabs below the header, and offsetting anchor-scroll targets).
- **`.gitignore` silently swallowing root markdown docs** - a blanket `*.md` rule, added in passing months ago before `md_files/` existed as the actual home for scratch markdown, was quietly ignoring any `.md` file that wasn't already tracked before the rule was added. Three real files had never once been tracked in git because of it: `CHANGELOG.md` itself, `docs/LOAD_TESTING.md` (which `README.md` had been linking to the whole time, pointing at a file that was never actually there), and `lexnorax_android/README.md`.

### Added
- **Order status for QR-ordering guests** - the order-status banner, which used to sit full-width under the header and push the whole menu down for as long as an order was active, is now a small floating pill (same idea as the existing cart bar) that opens a slide-up sheet with a Received → Preparing → Ready → Served timeline.
- **Reorder cart memory** - opening the cart to add a second round of items now shows a read-only "Already ordered" section above the new items, sourced from the same order-status data already being polled - the same idea as Swiggy/Zomato showing an earlier round when you add more to an in-progress order. Previously the cart only ever showed what was newly being added, with no memory of what had already been sent to the kitchen.
- **`celery_worker` and `celery_beat` services in docker-compose.yml** - the app has real scheduled tasks (`CELERY_BEAT_SCHEDULE` in `core/settings.py`) that had no way to run at all in a Dockerized deploy before this.
- 34 new tests: the split-bill QR fix (`orders/tests/test_bill_qr_amount_sync.py`, `payments/tests.py`), the order-status UI, the top-of-page gap regression, and the reorder-cart memory (all in `menu/tests.py`).

## Recent history

A condensed summary of the last two weeks of real, shipped work, grouped by theme rather than commit-by-commit. See `git log --since=2026-08-14` for the exact commits.

### 2026-09-04
- GSTR-1 export now includes Table 12 (HSN/SAC summary) - mandatory for every GST filer regardless of turnover, previously missing entirely.
- AI menu import now actually classifies veg/non-veg per item instead of silently defaulting everything to veg - fixed in both the Celery task path and the synchronous fallback path, plus the Gemini prompt and the manual/regex parser.
- Dark-mode dropdown text was invisible across the app, not just on the two element types first suspected - fixed everywhere the pattern occurred.
- The "Transfer Table" destination dropdown showed nothing with no explanation when no tables were free - now shows a clear fallback message.

### 2026-09-02 – 2026-09-03
- Fixed missing role checks on payment and setup endpoints, and a table-unmerge status bug.
- Fixed invisible white text in dropdown popups in dark mode (an earlier, narrower fix than the 09-04 one above).
- Added a pub-night simulation load test and a soak-test phase to `load_test`.

### 2026-08-26 – 2026-08-29
- Purchase orders: partial receiving, price variance capture, manual stock adjustment, draft editing, permission-gated vendor email.
- Fixed several real order/table-state bugs: adding an item after generating a bill silently splitting the order, sending to kitchen clobbering a billing table's state, a stale `order_id` wrongly blocking staff after a bill closes.
- Fixed duplicate and invisible notification badges, deduped low-stock alerts so one ongoing issue stopped looking like fifty, stopped the browser Back button from showing a stale authenticated page after logout.
