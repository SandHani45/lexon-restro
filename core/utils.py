    request.META['REMOTE_ADDR'] is always 127.0.0.1 in production. Anything
    keying off REMOTE_ADDR directly (rate limits, lockouts) was silently
    treating every visitor as the same client.

    client, so it's authoritative when present. Falls back to the first hop
    in X-Forwarded-For, then REMOTE_ADDR for direct/local connections
    (e.g. local dev, or hitting Nginx without Cloudflare in front).
